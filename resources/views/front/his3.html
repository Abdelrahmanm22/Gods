        <h1>Geb</h1>
        <p>-was the Egyptian god of the earth and a mythological member of the Ennead of Heliopolis. He could also be considered a father of snakes. It was believed in ancient Egypt that Geb's laughter created earthquakes and that he allowed crops to grow.</p>
        <p>-According to the ancient Egyptian religious legend, Geb married his sister Nut , and they had Osiris, Isis, Set , and Nephthys . This myth also considers that Geb and Nut also gave birth to the sun, and thus they are among the fathers of the group of gods that the ancient Egyptian believed in.</p>
        <p>-Geb was revered in Heliopolis as the father of the gods, most notably Osiris.  Geb was also worshiped in Memphis and Kom Ombo , as mentioned on the walls in the Temple of Amun in the city of Hebes. </p>
        <p>-The priests of the local main temple are identified in the Egyptian texts as "Sukneptunes-Gib". In contrast, in Greek texts, they identify as "Soknebtunis-Cronus". Moreover, the Egyptian names formed in the name of the god Geb were popular among the local villagers.</p>
         <div class="dis1">
         <p>-Geb is represented in the form of a seated human being and is colored green. In most of the drawings, we find him lying on the ground - as if he is to the ground - and his sister and wife, Nut , the goddess of the sky, surmounts him. Sometimes we find him depicted in the form of a standing man holding a scepter (scepter of Wass ) and in his right hand holding an ankh , the sign of life. He is also sometimes depicted in the form of a human being carrying a goose on his head , and his name is written from two syllables: goose and man, where the man is pronounced as the letter “b”. As for the goose that the ancient Egyptian chose to write the name “Geb”, it is a Nile goose that was domesticated by the ancient Egyptians in the early days</p>
          <p>-In Greco-Roman Egypt, people equated Geb with the Greek god Kronos. This has been since Cronus held the position of father of the gods in Greek mythology. Furthermore, the Teptunes painted local icons of the deities. Here the Teptunis describe Geb as a man with the attributes of Kronos and Kronos with the attributes of Geb.</p>

        <h1>Nut</h1>
        <p>-Nut (Ancient Egyptian: Nwt), also known by various other transcriptions, is the goddess of the sky, stars, cosmos, mothers, astronomy, and the universe in the ancient Egyptian religion. She was seen as a star-covered nude woman arching over the Earth, or as a cow. She was depicted wearing the water-pot sign (nw) that identifies her.</p>
        <p>-The goddess of the sky in the ancient Egyptian religion, and she is usually drawn with stars. According to the religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians, she is the sister of Geb , the god of the earth, and their father is Shu, the god of air, and their mother, Tefnut , the goddess of moisture (or the goddess of fire, as interpreted by some historians) </p>
        <p>-The Chamber of Nut, the Holy of Holies and new catacombs in the Dendera Temple..<a href="bookup.php" style=" color: darkblue;"> reserve here</a></p>
        <p>-The goddess Nut is one of the main deities of the ancient Egyptians related to creation, and she is among the so-called “Ennead of Heliopolis”, meaning the nine gods related to the process of creating the world, and they were worshiped in Heliopolis ( Ain Shams now).  </p>
         <div class="dis2">
         <p>- According to this myth of creation, Nut is the daughter of Shu , the god of air, and her mother, Tefnut , the goddess of moisture and rain, and she is considered the granddaughter of the sun god, Atum . Nut married her brother Geb , the god of the earth, and they had four sons, two males and two females: Osiris, Set, Isis , and Nephthys .</p>
          <p>-According to the religious legend of the ancient Egyptians, Nut is sometimes called the "mother of Horus, " since his immediate mother, Isis , had carried him while she was in the womb of her mother, Nut, where Osiris impregnated her . And it is mentioned in a manuscript called “The Book of Nut” that Nut is the mother of Ra (the sun) and her husband Osiris</p>

        <h1>Isis</h1>
        <p>-Isis was a major goddess in ancient Egyptian religion whose worship spread throughout the Greco-Roman world. Isis was first mentioned in the Old Kingdom as one of the main characters of the Osiris myth, in which she resurrects her slain brother and husband, the divine king Osiris.</p>
        <p>-In the Hellenistic period (323-30 BC) when the Greeks ruled Egypt , the Egyptians and the Greeks worshiped Isis as well as a new god named Serapis . Their worship spread to the wider Mediterranean world . </p>
        <p>-The Temple of Isis is located on the eastern bank of Aswan Governorate, next to the eastern fence of the city. The temple was partially built during the reigns of King Ptolemy III and King Ptolemy IV, and it was later converted into a church, most likely for Saint Mary. The temple is one of the most important archaeological discoveries preserved in good condition so far since it was found in 1871, where the temple still stands tall with its four walls and a roof with distinctive granite panels....<a href="bookup.php" style=" color: darkblue;"> reserve here</a></p>
        <p>-With Rome's absorption of Hellenistic culture in the first century BC, the cult of Isis became part of Roman religion. Although her worshipers were a small part of the Roman EmpireHowever, they were scattered throughout. Her followers began to develop some festivals such as the "Pass of Isis" festival, in addition to some new celebrations that were similar to the Greco-Roman mysteries . Some followers said that she included all the powers of the female deities in the world.</p>
         <div class="dis3">
         <p>-She gave birth to his heir, Horus .And she protected him. It was believed that Isis guides the dead to the afterlife as she helped Osiris, and was considered the divine mother of the pharaoh, as he was likened to her son, Horus. Her motherly assistance was a healing incantation to help the common people. Originally, Isis played a minor role in royal hymns and temple rituals, but she was more important in burial rituals and magical texts</p>
          <p>-She was often represented in art as a human female wearing something like a throne on her head. During the New Kingdom , the features that Hathor - the formerly prominent goddess - enjoyed, took on, as Isis became represented wearing Hathor's clothes, with a sun disk on her head between the horns of a cow, as Hathor was previously represented.</p>
          <p>-The Greeks endowed Isis with some of the features that distinguished the Greek gods, such as the invention of marriage and the protection of ships at sea, and maintained strong links between Egypt and other Egyptian deities that spread in the Hellenistic era, such as Osiris and Harpocrates.</p>

        <h1>Nephthys</h1>
        <p>-Nephthys or Nebet-Het in ancient Egyptian  was a goddess in ancient Egyptian religion. A member of the Great Ennead of Heliopolis in Egyptian mythology, she was a daughter of Nut and Geb. Nephthys was typically paired with her sister Isis in funerary rites because of their role as protectors of the mummy and the god Osiris and as the sister-wife of Set.</p>
        <p>-A few ancient Egyptian temple theologians call Nephthys the "assistant deity" or the "excellent goddess". These Egyptian texts describe the goddess as someone who represents protective guardianship and divine help. Moreover, mythology considers the goddess to be the mother of the god Anubis. However, in other myths, Anubis appears as the son of Isis or Bastet</p>
        <p>-According to the famous Osiris story, the goddess was called the primary nursing mother of the personified god Horus . The texts regard her as the nurse of the ruling pharaoh. The tales depict Nephthys most often in this role. However, according to other myths, the goddess appeared as a dangerous and ferocious deity. Myths say that Nephthys could incinerate the enemies of the pharaoh with her hot breath</p>
         <div class="dis4">
         <p>-Moreover, the city of Memphis honored the goddess with the title of "Queen of the Embalming Shop". Here people associated her with the jackal-headed Anubis as a shepherd. In addition, people also considered the Goddess as a ceremonial deity. Her ritual could approve the consumption of alcohol beer</p>
          <p>-General textual themes represent the goddess as a person whose unique domain was the darkness or the dangerous edges of the desert. An ancient legend in the Westkar Papyrus tells the story of the goddess with Meskenet and Heket. In the tale, the gods were traveling as dancers in disguise while assisting the wife of a priest of Amun-Ra willing to bear children destined for fame and fortune</p>
          <p>-Many ceramic amulets depict Nephthys. In addition, the goddess is present in a variety of magical papyri that sought to invoke her noble qualities to aid mortals</p>

        <h1>Seth</h1>
        <p>-Seth (/sɛt/; Egyptological: swtx or Greek: Seth is a god of deserts, storms, disorder, violence, and foreigners in ancient Egyptian religion. In Ancient Greek, the god's name is given as Sēth. Seth had a positive role where he accompanies Ra on his barque to repel Apep, the serpent of Chaos. Seth had a vital role as a reconciled combatant.  He was lord of the Red Land, where he was the balance to Horus' role as lord of the Black Land.</p>
        <p>-In the Osiris myth, the most important Egyptian myth, Set is portrayed as the usurper who killed and mutilated his own brother, Osiris. Osiris's wife, Isis, reassembled his corpse and resurrected her dead husband with the help of the goddess Nephthys. </p>
        <p>-The resurrection lasted long enough to conceive his son and heir, Horus. Horus sought revenge upon Set and many of the ancient Egyptian myths describe their conflicts.</p>
         <div class="dis5">
         <p>-Set is often portrayed as a red-haired monster. The beast has a forked tail and cloven hooves or a messy red dog-like beast known as Sha. Modern scholars call it animal six. However, some scholars claim that the models are depicted after the Greyhound dynasty. Others assert that the depiction is a mythical creature he imagines representing Set Candid</p>
          <p>-Other symbols that represent Set are the hippopotamus, the crocodile, and the turtle. His primary association was with a serpent. Additionally, Set's titles include "Lord of the Desert" and "Ruler of the South". Set was originally a deity of Upper Egypt (the south) and the wastelands beyond the borders of Egypt.</p>
          <p>-The Greeks associated Set with Typhon, the divine monster who challenged the power of Zeus and was cast into Tartarus. Set was often associated with foreign deities such as the warrior goddess Anat of Ugarit in Syria . In addition, set links with the Queen of Heavens from Phoenicia. People believed that Set represented the dry, arid desert lands and faraway lands. Usually places that were outside Egypt . This was in contrast to what the god Osiris and Horus represented, the fertility of the Nile River valley.</p>

        <h1>Osiris</h1>
        <p>-Osiris is the god of fertility, agriculture, the afterlife, the dead, resurrection, life, and vegetation in ancient Egyptian religion. He was classically depicted as a green-skinned deity with a pharaoh's beard, partially mummy-wrapped at the legs, wearing a distinctive atef crown, and holding a symbolic crook and flail. </p>
        <p>-He was one of the first to be associated with the mummy wrap. When his brother, Set, cut him up into pieces after killing him, Isis, his wife, found all the pieces and wrapped his body up, enabling him to return to life. Osiris was at times considered the eldest son of the earth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut, as well as being brother and husband of Isis.</p>
        <p>-The ancient Egyptian's perception was that Horus would bring the dead person after his success in the scale test and present him to Osiris, and he would be given beautiful clothes and enter the garden "Paradise". Before that, the process of weighing the deeds of the deceased in this world must be completed by placing his heart on one of the scales, and the feather of Maat , the symbol of “justice and normal morals,” is placed on the other scale . If the feather is heavier than the heart of the deceased , then this means that the deceased was good during his life and of noble morals, so he takes beautiful clothes and enters the garden of “Paradise” to live in it contented and happy. And if the heart of the dead is heavier than the weight of a feather, then it means that he was a disobedient tyrant during his life. Then the heart and the dead body are thrown to a mythical animal that is standing next to the scale - its name is Amamout; Its head is that of a crocodile, its body is that of a lion, and its underside is that of a hippopotamus - and that animal will immediately devour it and that will be its eternal end</p>
         <div class="dis6">
          <p>-The Famous Tale of Isis and Osiris The fabled tale of Isis and Osiris is a surviving classic of Egyptian mythology. It embraces many themes that reappear in countless stories. These tales have led Egyptologists to believe that Isis and Osiris were ancient rulers. They brought civilization to the people of the Nile Valley. Moreover, they gave them law, art and culture.</p>
          <p>-The god Osiris was the judge of the dead and the underworld. Moreover, the agency of the qadi ruled all life and fertile the flood of the Nile . Osiris has also been called "he who is ever pitiful and youthful" and "the lord of silence". Moreover, the tales say that the kings of Egypt were associated with Osiris in death. This led them to inherit eternal life through the process of imitation magic.

The deity is associated with the hope of a new life after death. This led Osiris to relate to the cycles we see in nature, such as vegetation and the annual flooding of the Nile. The pharaoh is also associated with the solar rising of Orion and Sirius at the start of the new year.</p>

        <h1>Horus</h1>
        <p>-Horus or Heru, Hor, Har in Ancient Egyptian, is one of the most significant ancient Egyptian deities who served many functions, most notably god of kingship and the sky. </p>
        <p>-Horus was mentioned in one of the myths of ancient Egypt and was considered a symbol of goodness and justice. Osiris was his father, who was the god of resurrection and reckoning among the ancient Egyptians. According to religious legend, his evil uncle, Set , killed his father and distributed his parts throughout the Egyptian country. And his mother was Isis , so she collected the parts of his father's body, and this is considered the first process of embalming the dead, and she lived with his father's body. Horus was born after that, and he wanted to take revenge on his uncle and take revenge for his father, and that is why Horus is sometimes called “the protector of his father.” Horus lost his left eye in that battle. And assumed the throne of Egypt.</p>
        <p>-The Temple of Horus is one of the most complete ancient Egyptian temples located on the west bank of the Nile River in the city of Edfu. The construction of the temple took about 180 years, since the reign of King Ptolemy III (246-221 BC), in the year 237 BC. AD, until its construction was completed during the reign of King Ptolemy XII (80-51 BC) in the year 57 BC.</p>
        <p>-he temple dedicated to the worship of the god Horus consists of a huge edifice of two towers, preceded by two granite statues of Horus in the form of a falcon.

         <div class="dis7">
         <p>-The work of Horus for all the kings of Egypt was the highest example, as he avenged his father from his killer and was just. Therefore, they took the name "Horus of the Living", which is one of the oldest royal titles in ancient Egypt. His name was mentioned in ancient times in association with Hathor and the first Scorpion King. In this title, Horus appears standing on the palace edifice, surrounding the king's name.</p>
            <p>-The ancient Egyptians considered that Horus fathered four sons, namely: “Hapi”, “Amesti”, “Domotif” (meaning “protector of his mother”) and “Kabhasanuf” (meaning “giver of drink to his brother”). In the Book of the Dead, there is usually a picture of Osiris sitting on a throne in the afterlife, and behind him are his two sisters, Isis and Nephthys, and in front of him stands [the four sons of Horus standing on a lotus flower to judge man. On the other hand, the preparation and embalming of the dead was done by opening their bodies and taking the heart (the heart is not extracted because with it the ancient Egyptian would go to the other world and live forever in the fields of Osiris) and the viscera and put them in four flasks (canopic pots) that make up the four sons of Horus to preserve their safety, and those flasks were The four are placed adjacent to the mummy, which is mummified and filled with materials that prevent its decomposition</p>
          <p>-Horus name was found on the Narmer painting or the famous King Mina painting, which is from the era of the first dynasty in Egypt, and he holds the heads of the defeated enemies of Egypt and presents them to the king. Until the Fourth Dynasty, the title of Pharaoh consisted only of the name Horus, and during that family the name Horus Golden also appeared, as a second title for the king.</p>

       <center> <h1>The myth of Isis and Osiris</h1> </center>
        <p>-The myth of Isis and Osiris is the most detailed and influential story in Pharaonic mythology . The story revolves around the murder of the god Osiris , Pharaoh of Egypt, and the consequences of this crime . After the crime, the murderer of Osiris, his brother Set , usurped the throne . At the same time, Isis struck the earth seeking and searching for her husband's body until she found it in Byblos , but six succeeded in stealing the body and cutting it into forty-two parts, and distributing it to the regions of Egypt .  Isis did not give up and was able to collect the remains of her husband, so she became pregnant and Isis after that gave birth to a son, HorusAnd Osiris became king in the realm of the dead.  The remainder of the story revolves around Horus , the child of Isis and Osiris, who at first was just a weak child protected by his mother, until he became Set's rival for the throne. Set's conflict with Horus, which was dominated by violence, ended with the victory of Horus, which restored to Egypt the system that it lacked under the rule of Set. Horus then completed the process of reviving Osiris. This myth , with its complex symbols , completes the Egyptian concepts of the monarchy system , the succession of kings, and the struggle between order and chaos , and in particular death and resurrection .after death. Furthermore, the myth explains the distinctive features of each of the four deities at the center of the story and how many cults in ancient Egyptian religions trace their origin to this myt</p>
        <p>-The basic form of the Isis and Osiris myth was completed in the 24th century BC , or possibly earlier. Many elements of the myth stem from religious ideas, but the conflict between Horus and Set is likely to have occurred in part because of the regional conflict in Egypt in early history or in prehistory . Scientists have tried to find out the nature of the events that triggered this story, but their attempts did not yield conclusive results</p>
         <div class="dis8">
            <p>-Parts of the myth are found in a wide variety of ancient Egyptian texts , from funerary texts and magical incantations to short stories . Thus, the story is more detailed and cohesive than any other Pharaonic legend . However, no Egyptian source gives a complete and adequate idea of ​​the legend, and the events differ greatly according to the different sources. Although the Greek and Roman writings , specifically the book “On Customs and Customs” by Plutarch , provide more information about the myth, it does not always accurately reflect Egyptian beliefs . Thanks to these writings, the legend of Isis and Oswis continued even after the demise of most of the Pharaonic beliefs. This legend is still known to this day.</p>
            <p>-Some versions of the myth tell of Set's motive for killing Osiris. According to a spell in the Pyramid Texts, Set takes revenge on Osiris for kicking him,  however, in a Late Period text , Set's grievance is that Osiris had a sexual relationship with Nephthys , Set's wife and fourth child of Geb and Nut.  As for the murder itself, it was alluded to without an explanatory description. The Egyptians believed in the power of writing in influencing reality, so they avoided direct writing in events that had a very negative side, such as the death of Osiris.  They sometimes denied the death of Osiris in its entirety, although the traditionThe accumulated evidence of his murder makes it a clear fact .  Sometimes the texts suggest that Set was embodied in the form of a wild animal, similar to a crocodile or a bull , to kill Osiris. Other stories also indicate that the body of Osiris was thrown into the water or that he died by drowning , and this is due to the belief of the Egyptians that those who drowned in the Nile were among the saints .  Even the identity of the victim differs in different texts. Sometimes the slain is the god Haroris, the larger image of Horus, who was killed by Set and avenged by another image of Horus, who is the son of Haroris of Isis</p>
            <p>-By the end of the New Kingdom , the tradition developed as it became said that Set cut the body of Osiris into pieces and dispersed them all over Egypt, and centers loyal to Osiris in the country claimed that the body , or certain parts of it, were found near these centers . It was said that these body parts could be as many as forty-two, each equivalent to one of the forty- two provinces of Egypt.  With this, the god-king became the embodiment of his kingdom</p>
